# Experiment-7-IPMV
A **Butterworth Low-Pass Filter (BLPF)** in **Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV)** is used to remove high-frequency noise while retaining important low-frequency components. Unlike an **ideal low-pass filter**, it provides a **smooth transition** between passed and attenuated frequencies, reducing ringing effects.  

The filter's sharpness is controlled by its **order (\(n\))**:  
- **Low \(n\)** â†’ Smooth blurring, gradual transition.  
- **High \(n\)** â†’ Sharper cutoff, but possible artifacts.  

BLPF is widely used in **frequency domain filtering** for image smoothing and noise reduction, especially in applications requiring controlled blurring without sudden intensity changes. ðŸš€
